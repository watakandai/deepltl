# ***Kandai's Edit***
Use the Dockerfile to build an image & run a container on vs code.
Python version must be 3.7, numpy==1.19.5, tensorflow==2.2.0, and must install `spot` library for evaluation.
Also, add the following so that Python can find where the spot library is during the runtime.

```bash
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib' >> ~/.bashrc
```

# DeepLTL

This repository is the official implementation of the ICLR'21 paper [Teaching Temporal Logics to Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04218).

We trained a Transformer to predict solutions to linear-time temporal logical (LTL) formulas. Our trained models evince powerful generalization properties, namely, the generalization to the semantics of the logic, and the generalization to larger formulas than seen during training. This repository includes 1) a data generation framework for teaching reasoning tasks on propositional logic and LTL to a Transformer and 2) a training framework with our experimental results, where our models predict solutions to propositional and LTL formulas.

**Contribution.** Generally, formulas have many solutions and the training data thus depends on the particularities of the generator.
While the Transformer does not perfectly predict the generatorâ€™s output, it still produces correct solutions to almost all formulas, even when its prediction deviates from the generator.
With this learning framework, it seems to be easier to learn the semantics of the logics than the particularities of the generator.

The Transformer preserves this semantic generalization even when challenged with formulas of a size it has never encountered before (see following picture):

Performance of our best model *(only trained on LTL formulas up to length 35)* on LTL formulas up to length 50 with a tree positional encoding. Exact syntactic matches are displayed in green, the semantic accuracy in light green and the incorrect predictions in orange. The shaded area indicates the formula sizes the model was not trained on. For more details see [Teaching Temporal Logics to Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04218).

Surprisingly, the Transformer solves almost all LTL formulas in our test set including those for which our generator timed out. For example, very complex formulas such as (LTL formula above, predicted satisfying trace below):

## Data Generation
### Linear-Time Temporal Logic
The **ltl-35** dataset was created by calling
```
python -m deepltl.data.generator --num-aps 5 --num-formulas 1000000 --tree-size 35 --timeout 120 --alpha 0.112
```
where `alpha` is used to tune the distribution of formulas, so that it is actually uniform in size.
For more details on available parameters, consider the help (`-h`).

### Propositional Logic
To generate a propositional logic dataset, the following additional package is required:
* `py-aiger-cnf`: simple_aig2cnf branch from https://github.com/MarkusRabe/py-aiger-cnf/tree/simple_aig2cnf

The **prop-35** dataset was created by calling
```
python -m deepltl.data.sat_generator --num-aps 5 --num-examples 1000000 --max-size 35 --alpha 0.095 --target-directory data_prop
```
Different node distributions and minimal sizes have to be set manually in the code.
